## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How can I change the default generated password length? ###
The default password length is `20` and can be overridden with a filter. Simply add this hook to your theme's `functions.php` file or as an [MU plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins):

```php
add_filter( 'spg_default_password_length', 12 );
```

### How can I change the minimum required generated password length? ###
The default minimum password length is `7` and can be overridden with a filter. Simply add this hook to your theme's `functions.php` file or as an [MU plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins):

```php
add_filter( 'spg_min_password_length', 8 );
```

Note: This setting only affects the minimum length of _generated passwords_, not passwords manually created by users.

### How can I change the maximum generated password length allowed? ###
The default maximum password length is `32` and can be overridden with a filter. Simply add this hook to your theme's `functions.php` file or as an [MU plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins):

```php
add_filter( 'spg_max_password_length', 50 );
```

Note: This setting only affects the maximum length of _generated passwords_, not passwords manually created by users.

### How can I generate passwords that are easier to memorize? ###
The default mode for password generation is non-memorable (alphanumeric + special characters), but this too can be overridden with a filter so that generated passwords are purely alphabetic, making them easier for users to memorize. Simply add this hook to your theme's `functions.php` file or as an [MU plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins):

```php
add_filter( 'spg_allow_memorable_passwords', '__return_true' );
```
